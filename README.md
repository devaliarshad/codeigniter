Instructions:-

1. Channge database credentials in app/Config/Database.php
2. Run Migations
3. Run/Serve app.
4. Wordpress plugin in located in plugin directory names "cake".

Taks :-

To demonstrate your knowledge of CodeIgniter and Wordpress, please create a lightweight CodeIgniter API that can serve content (let's use Cakes for example.)
- Create a basic CodeIgniter CRUD application for managing the cakes (Completed)
- Create a basic API endpoint for cake. User should be able to see all cakes on landing page. When clicked, viewing individual cakes that should show metadata of cake name and recipe on a new page. There should also be a "mock" purchase of the cake. Should have a purchase button that confirms price, nothing more is required.(Completed)
- Create a basic Wordpress plugin that has it's own "theme" directory in the active Wordpress theme (Completed loaded plugin theme files in current theme that what i was answered to my question)
- The plugin should be able to search, view and purchase the cakes from the user-facing Wordpress website (Completed except could not complete the step for "user-facing Wordpress website" as this could be done by "shortcodes". i do not have much experience in shortcodes)

Here is a loom video of what i have done:-
